Geometry of Congruent numbers

(C)2023. Simon Aranda

Algebraic forms, elliptic curves, surfaces, cuts and projections, quadratic equations, double points, right triangles, squares, arithmetic of elliptic points, discriminant functions, plane curves, graphs of functions, rational points, Heegner points, rank of an elliptic curve, statistics.

The multiple properties of all these elements, as well as the various relationships between them.

At present, Tunnell Thm. avoids looking for a first point on a curve that has none. Yet the problem of how to find it efficiently for large numbers remains open. Heegner-type points are complicated and limited. 
Determining the range of a congruent curve is not easy. Constructing a curve of a given range is quite difficult.

Multiple C++ programmes are included. 
Minimalist C++ programs, as building blocks for any specific project.
