Geometry of Congruent numbers.
(C) 2023. Simon Aranda.

- Congruent numbers, discriminant functions, Rank Distribution.
- Congruent Elliptic curves, Rational points, Generators.
- Points Order 12+, Heegner points.
- Law group of the abelian variety.
- Every rational point of C[n] belongs to a group of four points (the Bunch).
- Algebraic forms, Quadratic equations.
- Surfaces, cuts and projections. Right Triangles, squares. 
- the properties of all these elements.
- the relationships between them.
- All Equations fully proofed, programmed in C++ and Tested.
- Multiple C++ programs are included.
