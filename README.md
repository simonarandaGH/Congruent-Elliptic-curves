The subject of the project is the exploration of elliptic curves, their properties and their applications. One of the objectives is to develop a program that calculates the range of an elliptic curve. The project also includes the application of elliptic curves to general integer factorisation.
At each stage of the development process this repository will be kept up to date. 

Description of some of the topics addressed.

Elliptic curves [A, B] and in particular C[n]=[ -n^2, 0]. 
Where [A, B] denotes the Weierstrass normal form [y^2 = x^3 + A*x + B].

The "Surface 1" which is trivially derived from the family of curves C[n]. And the "Surface 2", which arises from the same equation as the curve C[n].

Tunnell's Theorem. Implementation of the test. Definition of the function r(n) and various conjectures about this function.

The form XYW(n) and the form PQRS(n) which allow us to obtain the usual right triangles of area n. And also provide points on the elliptic curves C[n] and the surfaces mentioned.

The XRANK program.  Which implements all the above points and complements them with various algebraic, algorithmic and computational aspects.
