# xrank
Rank of elliptic curves.

Description of the topics covered.

Elliptic curves: y^2 = x^3 + A*x +B, [A,B].
Especially the case: [-n^2,0]. C[n]: y^2 = x^3 - (n^2)*x.

The "surface 1" : z^2 = x * (x+ y^2), 
which is trivially derived from this family of curves.

The "surface 2" : z^2 = x^2 - (y^2)/x, 
which arises from the previous one, 
after a simple change of variables.

Tunnell's Theorem.
And my conjectures about the function r(n) which is defined.

The form xyw(n^2) and the form pqrs(n).
These forms give curve points and surfaces.
As well as other geometric objects.

The xrank program. Calculation of the range of C[n].
Which includes all the previous topics and complements them 
with new algebraic aspects.

The general objective of the project is the study of elliptic curves, their properties and their applications. One of the objectives is to develop a program that calculates the range of an elliptic curve. At each stage of the development process the repo will be kept up to date. The project includes analysing the application of this family of elliptic curves to general integer factorisation.
