Description of some of the topics addressed.

Elliptic curves C[n] = [ -n^2, 0], where [A,B] denotes the Weierstrass short form.

Tunnell's Theorem. Implementation of the Criteria. Definition of the function r(n) and various conjectures about this function.

The "Surface 1" which is trivially derived from the family of curves C[n]. And the "Surface 2", which arises from the same equation as the curve C[n].

The form XYW(n) and the form PQRS(n) which allow us to obtain the usual right triangles of area n. And also provide points on the elliptic curves C[n] and the surfaces mentioned.

The XRANK program.  Which implements all the above points and complements them with various algebraic, algorithmic and computational aspects.
