Description of some of the topics addressed.

Elliptic curves C[n], the Weierstrass short normal form [-n^2,0].

Tunnell's Theorem. Implementation of the Criteria. Definition of the function r(n) and conjectures about this function.

The forms XYW(n), PQRS(n), GNP(n) which allow us to obtain the usual right triangles of area n. And also provide points on the elliptic curves C[n] and the two Surfaces.

The "xrank" program.  Which implements all the above points and complements them with various algebraic, algorithmic and computational aspects.
