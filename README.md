Congruent Elliptic Curves. Short form [-n^2, 0].

From the Tunnell criterion arises the function r(n). The distribution over n mod 8 is shown. And the conjecture is defended that:

1 - r(n)=1 indicates odd rank, r(n)=2 even rank.

2 - the total of curves of rank 0 or even rank is equal to that of odd rank.

3 - Let all n<1254 , r(n)=1, have rank 1.

4 - Let all n<29274, r(n)=2, have rank 2.

The PQRS form is used to visualise record numbers with 8 right triangles of area n. And of numbers with 7 triads of squares.

One isomorphism between any point Cn and one form xyw is formalised.
From XYW arises the duality of every point in Cn.

The form GNP characterises every number CN and allows a formal enumeration by means of the function big(n,P).

The surface-2 containing all elliptic curves Cn.

Two programs in beta development:
The PointFinder program that finds Cn points and relates them to the finite base of generating points. The xrank.cpp program that calculates the range of each Cn curve.

OEIS ref. GNP is A271576, a subset of XYW.
PQRS is A009112, a subset of XYW. XYW is a subset of A003273 (CN).
