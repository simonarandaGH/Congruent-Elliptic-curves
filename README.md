Geometry of Congruent numbers.
(C)2023. Simon Aranda.

Congruent numbers, discriminant functions, graphs of functions, statistics. Right triangles, squares. 

Congruent elliptic curves, rational points, generator points, points 12+ order, Heegner points, Dual points. Law group of the abelian variety. 
Surfaces, cuts and projections.

Algebraic forms, quadratic equations, plane curves, crossing points.

The multiple properties of all these elements, as well as the various relationships between them. From one single point the whole scheme emerges. The dual point, the first form XYW, the way to the form PQRS, the second form XYW. 
Multitude of equations and their relation to the group law of the abelian variety.

At present, Tunnell Thm. avoids looking for a first point on a curve that has none. Yet the problem of how to find it efficiently for large numbers remains open. 
Heegner-type points are complex and limited. 
Determining the rank of a congruent curve is not easy.

Multiple C++ programmes are included. Minimalist C++ programs, as building blocks for any specific project.
