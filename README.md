Geometry of Congruent numbers.
(C) 2023. Simon Aranda.

- Congruent numbers, discriminant functions, graphs of functions, statistics. Right triangles, squares. 
- Congruent elliptic curves, rational points, generator points, points 12+ order, Heegner points, Dual points. Law group of the abelian variety. 
- Surfaces, cuts and projections.
- Algebraic forms, quadratic equations, plane curves, crossing points.

The multiple properties of all these elements, as well as the various relationships between them. 
Multiple C++ programmes are included. Minimalist C++ programs, as building blocks for any specific project.
