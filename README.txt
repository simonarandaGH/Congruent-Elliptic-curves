Geometry of Congruent numbers
(C) 2023. Simon Aranda

Congruent numbers, discriminant functions, graphs of functions, statistics. Right triangles, squares. Surfaces, cuts and projections.

Congruent elliptic curves, rational points, generator points, points 12+ order, Heegner points, Dual points. Law group of the abelian variety. 
Algebraic forms, quadratic equations.

The properties of all these elements, as well as the various relationships between them. Equations and their relation to the group law of the abelian variety. Multiple C++ programs are included. As building blocks for any specific project.
