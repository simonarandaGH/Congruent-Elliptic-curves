The Form GNP

Every congruent number m satisfies the equation:

[g^2] = [ (m*(c^2)) ^2] - [p^4] ;  All variables being positive integers.

The elliptic curve C[n], n= m*(c^2) has point P(- p^2, pg)
For example, for m=5, n=5, C[5]:P(-4,6). In effect: 6^2 = (-4)^3 - (5^2)*(-4).
Although this equation includes several powers, its efficiency and performance is considerable.

Reading the expression 9 + 16 = 25 leads us to think of a triangle(rect) with hypotenuse 5: (3, 4, 5). Not a triangle of area 5. 
However: 3^2 = 5^2 - 2^4, leads us to the triangle (3/2, 20/3, 41/6).
Whenever the smaller side is a square there is a triangle with area equal to the value of the hypotenuse.
The triangle (3, 4, 5) is the form GNP (3,5,2) and the triangle mentioned above. And the general formula of the triangle of the form GNP is:

form GNP(g, n, p) -> T( g/p, 2np/g, (g^2+2p^4)/pg).
