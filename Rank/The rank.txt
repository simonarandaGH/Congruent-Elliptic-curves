Notes

The curves C[n] are a quadratic twist of the curves: D*y^2= n^3 - n.

Rank & Core functions  "rank(n) = rank(core(n))"
The curve C[n*(a^2)] may have more integral points than C[n], but the rank does not increase.

Rational points = (Z/2Z x Z/2Z) x Z^rank
4 torsion points with y=0 and order 2.
Others rational points: always infinite order.
