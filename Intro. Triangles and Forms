Rectangular triangles and forms XYW and PQRS.

Is there any triangle (rectangle, always) with sides Q and area 5?
The first affirmative answer is given by the number 5*4 = 20.
20 is a number XYW:
20^2 = 16*25 = 16*(16+3^2) = xyw(16,3,25).
Therefore its triangle is: (3, 40/3, 41/3).
This triangle has area 20.

Is there any triangle of integer sides with area 5 ?
From the solution xyw it follows that a form pqrs will be obtained with n= 5*4*9 = 180.
Where 9 is the square of the denominator of the hypotenuse.
The 180 is a PQRS number:
180 = 5* 36 * 4*45; Where 45 = 5+36+4.
And therefore its triangle is: (p+r,q+r,p+q) = (9, 40, 41).
Which has area 180.

We have used squares to get shapes and from these triangles. The reverse path will give the triangle for 5:
(9,40,41) -> (9/6, 40/6, 41/6).
(3, 40/3, 41/s) -> (3/2, 40/6, 41/6).
Which simplifying is: (3/2, 20/3, 41/6).
The same in both cases.

Is the solution pqrs (p+r,q+r,p+q) always a Pythagorean triangle? That is: (p+r)^2 + (q+r)^2 = (p+q)^2.
Demonstration. It follows that:
(p+r)^2 = ps-qr; see basic properties of the form pqrs.
(q+r)^2 = qs-pr; id.
Where: s(p+q)-r(p+q) = (p+q)(s-r)= (p+q)(p+q+r-r).
It is proved.

Every form PQRS always gives two forms XYW:
xyw(pr, (q+r), qs) and (qr, (p+r), ps).

In the case n=180, from pqrs(5,36,4,45) we obtain:
xyw(5*4, 36+4, 36*45 ) = xyw(20, 40, 1620).
xyw(36*4, 5+4, 5*45 ) = xyw(144, 9, 225).

Summary
Leaving aside the issue of squares and always talking about right-angled triangles.

If n has a shape xyw, n has a triangle of area n with rational sides.
If n has a shape xyw it has also a shape pqrs.
If n has a shape pqrs it also has two shapes xyw.
Even if both forms are realised in integers,
only the form pqrs guarantees integer sides.

There is therefore an equivalence between knowing a triangle 
of area n, a form xyw of n and a form pqrs of n.
The set of numbers n satisfying this condition 
is called congruent numbers.
The free subset of squares is called primitive congruent integers.
Just look it up in Wikipedia.
