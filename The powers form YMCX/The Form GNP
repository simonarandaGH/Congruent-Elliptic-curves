The Form GNP

Every congruent number m satisfies the equation:

[g^2] = [ (m*(c^2)) ^2] - [p^4] ;  All variables being positive integers.

The elliptic curve C[n], n= m*(c^2) has point P(- p^2, pg)
For example, for m=5, n=5, C[5]:P(-4,6). In effect: 6^2 = (-4)^3 - (5^2)*(-4).
Although this equation includes several powers, its efficiency and performance is considerable.
