Rectangular triangles and forms XYW, PQRS.
(C)2023. Simon Aranda

The right triangle PQRS is: (p+r,q+r,p+q).
The XYW forms:  xyw(pr,(q+r),qs) and xyw(qr,(p+r),ps).
They give the same right triangle: (y, 2n/y, (x+w)/y).

From a single point one PQRS form can be derived, 
also two XYW forms and the set of 4 points to which it belongs.
These 4 points together with the Torsion group do not form a closed subgroup, but the set new forms and new points arise.

Leaving aside the issue of squares and always talking about right-angled triangles.
If n has a form xyw, n has a triangle of area n with rational sides.
If n has a form xyw it has also a form pqrs.
If n has a form pqrs it also has two forms xyw.
Even if both forms are realised in integers, only the form pqrs guarantees integer sides.
There is therefore an equivalence between knowing a triangle 
of area n, a form xyw of n, and a form pqrs of n.
The set of numbers n satisfying this condition is called congruent numbers.
