Graphically, various relationships are observed between the generating point of a rank one curve, the Heegner point and the torsion points.
Naturally, two new points N and C arise. N on the horizontal axis, C on the curve. Both with rational coordinates.
In addition, several triangles with always rational area can be observed. And several of the lines joining these points are degenerate conics.
