# Tunnell Thm.

Tunnell's test for integer candidates for congruent numbers. 
It is based on two well-known functions a(n), b(n). 
Where if n is a congruent number then/when: a(n)= 2*b(n).

My function r(n) is defined as:
  if (a==b==0)      then r(n)=1.
  if (b>0 && a==2b) then r(n)=2.
  All other cases,  r(n)=0.

I conjectured that:

- integers with r(n)=1, have odd rank (1,3,...).
- if (n< 1254 && r(n)=1) then rank(n)=1.

- integers with r(n)=2, have even rank (2,4,...).
- if (n<29274 && r(n)=2) then rank(n)=2.

- the total of n with r(n)=(0 or 2) is equal 
to the total of n with r(n)=1,
except for some very small difference.

The xrank program incorporates a small table with the value of certain critical numbers. Those where the range of the curve reaches a rank never reached before.
